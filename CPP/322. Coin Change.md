# [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/#/solutions)
* the recursion formula is very simple : dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-coins[0]], dp[i-coins[1].....)
* but the code is not easy, should notice some points:
* we can use Max = amount+1 as the inital value, because even if the coins is all 1, the number will not be larger than amount, so that we can use this value to make sure the min function can always get the right value

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        int Max = amount+1;
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, Max);
        dp[0] =0;
        for(int i =1; i<=amount; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<coins.size(); j++){
                if(i >= coins[j])
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-coins[j]]+1);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[amount] > amount? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};

```
