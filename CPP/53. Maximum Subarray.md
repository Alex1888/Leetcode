# [53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

* Idea is very simple. Basically, keep adding each integer to the sequence until the sum drops below 0.
If sum is negative, then should reset the sequence.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxres = nums[0], tmp = 0;
        int len = nums.size();
        for (int i= 0; i<len; i++){
             tmp += nums[i];
             if(tmp > maxres)
                maxres = tmp;
             if(tmp < 0)
                tmp = 0;
            }
        
        return maxres;
    }
};
```
