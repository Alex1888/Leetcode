# [188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/description/)

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```
Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```       
             
* 这个定义方法是最好理解的： https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/discuss/54117/Clean-Java-DP-solution-with-comment
* dp[i][j]表示到达prices[j]时用了最多i次操作得到的最大利润

```c++
/**
 * dp[i, j] represents the max profit up until prices[j] using at most i transactions. 
 * dp[i, j] = max(dp[i, j-1], prices[j] - prices[jj] + dp[i-1, jj]) { jj in range of [0, j-1] }
 *          = max(dp[i, j-1], prices[j] + max(dp[i-1, jj] - prices[jj])) <= 关键在这步
 * dp[0, j] = 0; 0 transactions makes 0 profit
 * dp[i, 0] = 0; if there is only one price data point you can't make any transaction.

        	}
        }

    }
